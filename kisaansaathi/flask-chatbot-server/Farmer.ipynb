      "\n",
      "--- KisaanSetu AI Assistant Response ---\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, I understand. Here's some advice on protecting your paddy and coconut crops from wild animals and maximizing your profit, considering the humidity in your area:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Protecting your crops from wild animals:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Physical Barriers:** Since repellent sprays wash away easily due to humidity, focus on physical barriers.  Erect a strong fence around your field.  Consider a solar-powered electric fence; it's effective and doesn't rely on constant re-application like sprays. Contact your local agricultural department; they might offer subsidies for fencing materials.\n",
      "2.  **Trench Method:** Dig a trench around the perimeter of your field. The trench should be wide and deep enough to deter common local wild animals (consult with other local farmers to determine appropriate dimensions for your area). This acts as a physical obstacle.\n",
      "3.  **Guard Animals:** Consider using guard dogs or livestock (like geese) to patrol your field. They can deter animals with their barking or presence. If you choose guard dogs, train them well and ensure they are properly cared for.\n",
      "4.  **Noise Deterrents:**  Use motion-activated noisemakers (alarms, sirens, or even radios playing loudly) to scare away animals. Move them around periodically so the animals don't get used to the sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Growing Paddy for High Profit:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **High-Yielding Varieties:** Choose paddy varieties known for high yields in your region. Your local agricultural extension officer can recommend the best options, considering your soil and climate. Look for varieties resistant to common local diseases.\n",
      "2.  **Nursery Management:** Start with healthy seedlings. Prepare a well-drained nursery bed and use certified seeds. Ensure proper spacing to prevent overcrowding.\n",
      "3.  **Transplanting:** Transplant seedlings carefully, maintaining proper spacing. This allows for better root development and reduces competition for resources.\n",
      "4.  **Water Management:** Paddy needs adequate water, but avoid waterlogging. Implement efficient irrigation techniques like alternate wetting and drying (AWD) to conserve water and improve yields. Your local agriculture office can provide specifics on AWD techniques.\n",
      "5.  **Nutrient Management:** Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient deficiencies. Apply fertilizers based on the soil test recommendations. Consider using a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Compost and vermicompost can improve soil health.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Growing Coconut for High Profit:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Choose Suitable Varieties:** Select coconut varieties suitable for your region's climate and soil. Talk to experienced coconut farmers or your local agricultural extension officer. Dwarf varieties often mature faster.\n",
      "2.  **Proper Spacing:** Plant coconut seedlings with adequate spacing (typically 7.5 to 9 meters apart). This allows for proper sunlight and air circulation, reducing disease risks.\n",
      "3.  **Intercropping:** In the initial years, utilize the space between coconut trees by intercropping with cash crops like bananas, vegetables, or legumes. This generates income while the coconut trees mature.\n",
      "4.  **Nutrient Management:** Coconut trees need regular fertilization. Apply organic and inorganic fertilizers based on soil test results. Include micronutrients like boron and zinc, if deficient.\n",
      "5.  **Water Management:** Coconut trees need regular watering, especially during dry periods. Implement drip irrigation for efficient water use.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Notes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Local Expertise:** Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your region. They can provide information on subsidized inputs, government schemes, and best practices.\n",
      "*   **Market Research:** Research the market prices for paddy and coconuts in your area. Identify potential buyers and negotiate favorable prices. Look into value-added processing options (e.g., rice milling, coconut oil extraction) to increase your profits.\n",
      "*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your crops for pests and diseases. Take prompt action to prevent outbreaks. Your local agriculture officer can help you identify and manage these issues.\n",
      "*   **Humidity Management:** Although you mentioned humidity limits spraying repellents, monitor humidity trends. During brief dryer periods, try using repellents to reinforce defenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good luck with your crops!\n",

      "For the best fertilizer for wheat in Punjab, consider these options:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Basal application (at sowing): Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) at 50 kg per acre provides phosphorus, crucial for root development. Potash (MOP) at 25 kg per acre is also beneficial if your soil is deficient in potassium.\n",
      "2.  First top dressing (after first irrigation): Urea at 45 kg per acre. This provides nitrogen for vegetative growth.\n",
      "3.  Second top dressing (before second irrigation): Another dose of Urea at 45 kg per acre.\n",
      "4.  Foliar spray (for grain development): NPK 13:0:45 at 10 grams per liter of water. Spraying this will help in grain filling and making the grains shiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to adjust the fertilizer dose based on soil test results if available. This ensures you're not over- or under-fertilizing. Cost: A bag of urea (45 kg) typically costs around 266 rupees during the subsidy period. DAP is usually around 1200 rupees per bag.\n",

      "Fertilizers are like food for your plants. They help them grow bigger and stronger. Here's a simple explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  What they do: Fertilizers give plants the nutrients they need, like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Think of it like vitamins for humans.\n",
      "2.  Why use them: Your soil might not have enough of these nutrients naturally. Fertilizers help make up for what's missing. This means better yields and healthier crops.\n",
      "3.  Types: There are two main types:\n",
      "    *   Chemical fertilizers: These are made in factories and have specific amounts of nutrients. Examples are urea, DAP, and NPK mixtures.\n",
      "    *   Organic fertilizers: These come from natural sources like manure, compost, and bone meal.\n",
      "4.  How to use: Follow the instructions on the fertilizer bag. Don't use too much, or you can damage your plants. Mix well with the soil or dissolve in water before applying.\n",
      "5.  Cost Saving: Check for government subsidies. Fertilizer prices are often lower when the government provides support. Ask your local agriculture officer for details.\n",

      "Taar repellent spray is used to keep animals away from crops. Here's what you should know:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What it is: Taar spray usually contains ingredients that irritate animals like wild pigs, deer, and rabbits. It smells and tastes bad to them, so they avoid the sprayed areas.\n",
      "2. How it works: You spray it around the perimeter of your field or directly on the crops animals are eating. The strong smell discourages them from entering or feeding.\n",
      "3. Is it useful? Yes, it can be helpful, especially for crops that are easily damaged by animals. However, it might not work for all animals or in all situations. Heavy rain can wash it away, so you may need to reapply.\n",
      "4. Cost: A bottle of taar repellent spray typically costs between 200-400 rupees.\n",
      "5. Alternatives: Before using taar spray, consider fencing or netting. These options are more expensive initially, but they can provide longer-term protection. You can also try planting a \"sacrifice crop\" around your main field that animals can eat instead.\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay, Arnav, since we were just discussing taar repellent spray for keeping animals away, here are some other ways to protect your farm in Kerala from wild animals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Fencing:\n",
      "   - Types: Chain-link, barbed wire, or electric fences are effective. Electric fences are especially good against larger animals like wild pigs.\n",
      "   - Cost: Barbed wire fencing costs around 50-100 rupees per meter. Electric fences are more expensive initially but can save money long term.\n",
      "   - Subsidy: Check with your local agriculture office for fencing subsidies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Watchdogs:\n",
      "   - Breeds: Indian Pariah Dogs or Kombai are good choices. They are alert and protective.\n",
      "   - Training: Start training early. A good watchdog can deter many animals.\n",
      "   - Cost: The cost of a puppy varies, but local breeds are generally affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Motion-activated Lights and Alarms:\n",
      "   - How they work: These devices scare animals away when they enter your farm.\n",
      "   - Placement: Install them at entry points and near crops that are frequently targeted.\n",
      "   - Cost: Solar-powered lights cost around 500-1500 rupees each.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Plant Repellent Crops:\n",
      "   - Marigolds: Plant marigolds around your main crops. Their strong scent repels some animals and insects.\n",
      "   - Mint: Similarly, mint can deter certain pests.\n",
      "   - Benefit: This is a low-cost, natural method.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Community Vigilance:\n",
      "   - Form groups: Work with other farmers to patrol fields, especially at night.\n",
      "   - Share information: Alert each other about animal sightings and damage.\n",
      "   - Effectiveness: Group efforts can significantly reduce losses.\n",

    "## Examples of Good vs Bad Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Crop Disease Query\n",
    "**Query**: \"My tomato plants have yellow leaves and black spots. What should I do?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ BAD Response:**\n",
    "\"Your tomatoes might have early blight or late blight disease caused by fungal pathogens like Alternaria solani or Phytophthora infestans. You need to apply fungicides immediately.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ GOOD Response:**\n",
    "\"This sounds like blight disease in tomatoes. Here's what to do immediately:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove affected leaves: Cut and burn all yellow/spotted leaves to stop spread\n",
    "2. Apply neem oil spray: Mix 30ml neem oil + 1 tsp soap in 1 liter water, spray in evening\n",
    "3. Improve air circulation: Space plants properly, remove lower branches touching soil\n",
    "4. Stop overhead watering: Water at soil level only to keep leaves dry\n",
    "5. Apply copper sulfate: If available, spray 2g per liter water every 7 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost: 50-100 rupees for neem oil treatment. Prevention: Plant disease-resistant varieties next season.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Fertilizer Query\n",
    "**Query**: \"When should I apply urea to my wheat crop?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ BAD Response:**\n",
    "\"Apply urea fertilizer according to soil test recommendations and crop growth stage requirements for optimal nitrogen uptake efficiency.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ GOOD Response:**\n",
    "\"For wheat, apply urea in 3 splits for best results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At sowing (November): 1/3 of total urea (about 65 kg/hectare)\n",
    "2. First irrigation (35-40 days): 1/3 of total urea\n",
    "3. Second irrigation (65-70 days): Remaining 1/3 urea\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing tip: Apply urea just before irrigation, not during rain. Mix with soil lightly.\n",
    "Local measurement: 1 bigha = about 13 kg urea total\n",
    "Cost saving: Buy during subsidy period (usually 266 rupees per bag vs 350+ later)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Market Price Query\n",
    "**Query**: \"What's the current price of onions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ BAD Response:**\n",
    "\"Onion prices fluctuate based on market dynamics, supply-demand factors, and seasonal variations across different mandis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ GOOD Response:**\n",
    "\"I don't have access to real-time market prices, but here's how to get current rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check eNAM portal: nafed.india.gov.in for daily mandi prices\n",
    "2. Call local mandi: Your nearest APMC will have today's rates\n",
    "3. WhatsApp groups: Join local farmer groups for price updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent trend info (if available in context): Based on KCC data, onion prices typically peak in May-July.\n",
    "Selling tip: Grade your onions - A-grade gets 5-8 rupees per kg more than mixed quality.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Makes Responses Good:\n",
    "- Specific numbers: Quantities, costs, timing\n",
    "- Local context: Indian measurements (bigha, hectare), rupees, local practices\n",
    "- Step-by-step action: Clear numbered instructions\n",
    "- Cost information: Actual prices or price ranges\n",
    "- Prevention tips: How to avoid the problem next time\n",
    "- Alternative solutions: Multiple options when possible\n",

    "- Irrelevant information: General advice not specific to query\n",

    "- Use relevant current/forecasted weather if applicable.\n",
    "- Deliver clear, actionable advice that can be implemented immediately.\n",
    "- Use affordable and practical techniques when possible.\n",
    "- Provide product recommendations only if necessary, with clear instructions.\n",
    "- Reference previous conversations when relevant and build upon earlier advice.\n",

    "- Respond in English using simple, conversational language.\n",
    "- Keep answers concise: 3-5 key points max.\n",
    "- Use numbered steps for instructions.\n",
    "- Avoid jargon unless explained.\n",

    "## Examples of Good vs Bad Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Crop Disease Query\n",
    "**Query**: \"My tomato plants have yellow leaves and black spots. What should I do?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ BAD Response:**\n",
    "\"Your tomatoes might have early blight or late blight disease caused by fungal pathogens like Alternaria solani or Phytophthora infestans. You need to apply fungicides immediately.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ GOOD Response:**\n",
    "\"This sounds like blight disease in tomatoes. Here's what to do immediately:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove affected leaves: Cut and burn all yellow/spotted leaves to stop spread\n",
    "2. Apply neem oil spray: Mix 30ml neem oil + 1 tsp soap in 1 liter water, spray in evening\n",
    "3. Improve air circulation: Space plants properly, remove lower branches touching soil\n",
    "4. Stop overhead watering: Water at soil level only to keep leaves dry\n",
    "5. Apply copper sulfate: If available, spray 2g per liter water every 7 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost: 50-100 rupees for neem oil treatment. Prevention: Plant disease-resistant varieties next season.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Fertilizer Query\n",
    "**Query**: \"When should I apply urea to my wheat crop?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ BAD Response:**\n",
    "\"Apply urea fertilizer according to soil test recommendations and crop growth stage requirements for optimal nitrogen uptake efficiency.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ GOOD Response:**\n",
    "\"For wheat, apply urea in 3 splits for best results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At sowing (November): 1/3 of total urea (about 65 kg/hectare)\n",
    "2. First irrigation (35-40 days): 1/3 of total urea\n",
    "3. Second irrigation (65-70 days): Remaining 1/3 urea\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing tip: Apply urea just before irrigation, not during rain. Mix with soil lightly.\n",
    "Local measurement: 1 bigha = about 13 kg urea total\n",
    "Cost saving: Buy during subsidy period (usually 266 rupees per bag vs 350+ later)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Market Price Query\n",
    "**Query**: \"What's the current price of onions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ BAD Response:**\n",
    "\"Onion prices fluctuate based on market dynamics, supply-demand factors, and seasonal variations across different mandis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ GOOD Response:**\n",
    "\"I don't have access to real-time market prices, but here's how to get current rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check eNAM portal: nafed.india.gov.in for daily mandi prices\n",
    "2. Call local mandi: Your nearest APMC will have today's rates\n",
    "3. WhatsApp groups: Join local farmer groups for price updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent trend info (if available in context): Based on KCC data, onion prices typically peak in May-July.\n",
    "Selling tip: Grade your onions - A-grade gets 5-8 rupees per kg more than mixed quality.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Makes Responses Good:\n",
    "- Specific numbers: Quantities, costs, timing\n",
    "- Local context: Indian measurements (bigha, hectare), rupees, local practices\n",
    "- Step-by-step action: Clear numbered instructions\n",
    "- Cost information: Actual prices or price ranges\n",
    "- Prevention tips: How to avoid the problem next time\n",
    "- Alternative solutions: Multiple options when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Makes Responses Bad:\n",
    "- Vague advice: \"Apply as needed\", \"consult expert\"\n",
    "- Technical jargon: Scientific names without explanation\n",
    "- No quantities: \"Apply fertilizer\" without amounts\n",
    "- No cost info: Expensive solutions without mentioning cost\n",
    "- Complex language: Academic or scientific terminology\n",
    "- Irrelevant information: General advice not specific to query\n",
    "\n",
    "## CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE:\n",
    "DO NOT use asterisks (*), markdown formatting, or special symbols in your response. Use plain text only with clear, simple formatting like colons and numbered lists.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Current Question\n",
    "{user_query}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Instructions:\n",
    "- For crop health issues: identify likely causes, suggest low-cost or organic solutions, preventive measures.\n",
    "- For market advice: provide local MSP, mandis, realistic price ranges, and timing recommendations.\n",
    "- For input recommendations: specify quantities, local measurements, and any available government schemes.\n",
    "- For water management: suggest irrigation schedules and water conservation techniques.\n",
    "- For technology adoption: suggest feasible technologies considering local availability, cost, and skill requirements.\n",
    "- If this question relates to previous advice from our conversation, acknowledge that connection and build upon it.\n",
    "- If farmer mentions success (\"it worked\", \"problem is solved\"), congratulate and provide next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Follow the GOOD response pattern shown in examples above. Be specific, practical, and cost-conscious. If you don't know something specific, clearly state \"I don't know\" and provide alternative ways to find the information.\n",
